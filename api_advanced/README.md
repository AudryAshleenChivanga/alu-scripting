Reading API Documentation for Endpoints:

Identify the base URL provided in the documentation.
Look for the 'Endpoints' or 'Resources' section to find available paths.
Review the HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) each endpoint supports.
Check required query parameters or request bodies.
Understand the structure of the response and error codes.
Refer to examples provided for clarity on requests and responses.
Using an API with Pagination:

Check documentation for pagination query parameters (like page, limit, offset).
Make initial API call with pagination parameters if needed.
Inspect the response for pagination details (e.g., links to next or previous pages).
Loop through pages by updating the pagination parameter in subsequent requests.
Handle the end of the pagination when no more pages are indicated in the response.
Parsing JSON Results from an API:

Use a JSON parser in your programming language (e.g., json in Python).
Convert JSON string to a native data structure (like a dictionary in Python).
Access the data by key-value pairs.
Handle any parsing exceptions or errors.
Optionally, use schema validation for expected JSON structure.
Making a Recursive API Call:

Define a function that makes an API call.
Within the function, after receiving the response, check for a condition that requires another call (like incomplete data).
If condition is met, call the same function recursively with updated parameters if necessary.
Implement a base case to stop recursion (like when all data is fetched or an error occurs).
Sorting a Dictionary by Value:

Use a sorting function provided by your programming language (like sorted() in Python).
Pass the dictionary’s items (key-value pairs) to the sorting function.
Specify a lambda or custom function to sort by the dictionary’s values.
Determine if the sort should be in ascending or descending order.
The result will typically be a list of tuples sorted by the dictionary’s values.
